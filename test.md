| **Order of steps**                  | The guide suggests the following sequence: **(1) choose Race & Ancestry**, **(2) select Profession**, **(3) generate Ability Scores**, **(4) pick Primary Path**, **(5) choose Background**, **(6) calculate Morality & Reputation**, **(7) assign ability modifiers**, **(8) fill in remaining blanks**【472†L1-L15】【540†L12-L24】.  It even advises waiting until you know your **Primary Path** before assigning scores, since paths have prerequisites【540†L4-L15】. | The `CharacterBuilder` sets **ability scores first** (`set_ability_scores` then moves to the race step) and chooses the **path** before the **background**.  The `docs/plans.md` file reflects this order: “choose ability‑score method; select race and ancestry; pick profession; pick primary path; select background; recalc stats”. | Assigning scores before knowing race/path may lead players to allocate points inefficiently; the rulebook explicitly suggests selecting race and primary path before assigning scores to meet prerequisites【540†L4-L15】.  Consider switching the order to match the rulebook.                                                |
| **Standard array**                  | The rulebook lists a *Standard Array* of **8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15**【472†L7-L20】 (seven numbers for six abilities, implying one number might be dropped or this could be a misprint).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The validator expects the standard array **[15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]** (six values) and will reject any other combination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | There is a mismatch; if the rulebook’s array is correct, the validator should include 11 and possibly adjust the values.  Clarify the intended standard array and update the validator accordingly.                                                                                                                          |
| **Point‑buy total and costs**       | The rulebook specifies **30 points** for point‑buy and provides costs for scores 8 through 16 (e.g., 8 → 0, 9 → 1, …, **16 → 11**)【472†L7-L20】.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The validator uses **27 points** (`POINT_DRAW_TOTAL = 27`) and only allows scores **8–15** with costs topping out at 9; **16** is not permitted.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Players following the rulebook could generate higher scores (up to 16) and spend 30 points; the current implementation prevents this.  To align with the rulebook, adjust `POINT_DRAW_TOTAL` to 30 and add cost 11 for score 16.                                                                                             |
| **Life point calculation**          | Table 1.1 shows how ability scores map to modifiers and life points: scores **10–11** give **10 life points**, **12–13** give **12**, **14–15** give **14**, **16–17** give **16**, etc【244†L1-L11】.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | In `recalculate_all`, life points are set to the Endurance *total* (`self.character.life_points.max = max(1, end_total)`).  That means a score of 11 gives 11 life points, 13 gives 13, 15 gives 15, etc.                                                                                                                                | The rulebook’s table “rounds down” odd scores (10–11 → 10, 12–13 → 12…), whereas the implementation uses the exact score.  To follow the rulebook, life points should step by two; e.g., `max(1, (end_total // 2) * 2)` or reference the table.  Updating this will ensure that odd scores give the proper life‑point value. |
| **Allowed maximum in point buy**    | The rulebook lists score 16 (cost 11) in the point‑buy table【472†L7-L20】.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The validator disallows any score above 15 during point draw and flags values <8 or >15 as errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | To match the rules, scores up to 16 should be permitted with the appropriate cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Morality & Reputation**           | Step 6 instructs players to “calculate and record your hero’s morality and reputation scores”【540†L20-L24】.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The character builder does not have an explicit step for morality/reputation.  Alignment and reputation modifiers are adjusted when personality traits/ideals/bonds/flaws are chosen, but there is no dedicated calculation step.                                                                                                        | If morality and reputation values are important for play, consider adding a finalisation step or including them in `recalculate_all` so that they’re clearly visible once all choices are made.                                                                                                                              |
| **Language list**                   | The rulebook lists languages including Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, Orcish, Goblin, Halffolk, Draconic, Celestial, Infernal, Sylvan, Aquan, Tauric, Simarru, Velkarran, and **Ancient Dwarvish**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The builder’s `_get_available_languages()` returns all of the above except **Ancient Dwarvish**, and the validator warns that unknown languages “may be valid”.                                                                                                                                                                          | If “Ancient Dwarvish” is a valid language, it should be added to the available language list so that players can select it without warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
